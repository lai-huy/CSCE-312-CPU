\section*{My Contribution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Execute
    \item Memory
    \item Lots and Lots of Debugging
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Advantages and Disadvantages}
This team based approach made it significantly easier to understand crucial components of this assignment, since we could each focus deeply on certain aspects of the CPU and explain them to the others.  It also allowed us to delegate work in a way that did not require any one of us to do an out-sized amount of work.  The disadvantage lies in the fact that the progress of this project is limited by the most dedicated individuals at that time, and in a world where we all procrastinated putting in the work to debug the machine, some of us were more involved than others in the crisis management phase of this project in the last few days, where we fixed all the many things that were broken, non operational, or simply incompatible.

\section*{Best Design}
Kyleâ€™s Decoder and Register File were superior.\\
Huy's Fetch, Write Back, and PC Update was superior.
